# Conventional Commits

Use Conventional Commits format for all commit messages.

Prefix every commit subject with one of these types, which map directly to
Keep a Changelog headings:

- `feat:` → **Added** - new features
- `refactor:` → **Changed** - changes to existing functionality
- `deprecated:` → **Deprecated** - soon-to-be removed features
- `removed:` → **Removed** - now removed features
- `fix:` → **Fixed** - bug fixes
- `security:` → **Security** - vulnerability fixes
- `chore:` → *(omitted from changelog)* - maintenance, tooling, config
- `docs:` → *(omitted from changelog)* - documentation-only changes

Append `!` after the type/scope for breaking changes, e.g. `feat!:` or `fix!:`.

Keep the subject line under 72 characters including prefix, imperative mood, no trailing period.
